## Guides
- [[Heat - Standard G3]]
- [[Heat - Fast Tempo]]
- [[Heat - Early Major]]

Rising Heat has lots of flexibility in the first 2 turns. Your turn 1 is always a G3, so based on what minor you draft you can jump straight in to any of the above 3 build paths.

## Unique Cards

Call on Herders for Aid
- Your best card by far. Immense flexibility and control.
Gift of Searing Heat
- In solo, HOLY HELL breaks the game wide open for you. Energy and damage both are useful.
	- Recommended to not take the bonus for self playing solo, so that multiplayer and solo gameplay do not have such stark differences. For fun and giggles, use it. For practice, no.
- In multiplayer, ignore the damage text. If they take the damage, they are effectively paying 3 energy (1 cost + opportunity cost of gaining 2) to deal a measly 1 damage in a land.
Stinging Sandstorm
- Presence movement is appreciated
Sweltering Exhaustion
- VERY fair skip card

## Play Patterns

A good amount of success found with this spirit will be in playing for it's innate power. It's very strong and capable of completely wiping out a land when maxed.

## Drafting
0-cost cards are king! Energy is very limited.

Needs a single ![[earth.png]]-element card to max out innate alongside unique cards. 98% chance to get this over the course of 4 drafts.


## Boards
Initial presence placement is the primary concern, due to G3 presence placement having a range of 1. More initial adjacencies and options to grow around are better options to start with.

The second consideration is Sweltering Exhaustion, which has a range of 2 from sacred site. Ideally your whole board will be within range when you want to use this, which some boards provide more advantageously

Rising Heat only experiences inconveniences with board choices. Some have advantages but the worst cases are just a little awkward in the first couple turns. Very resilient in this aspect.

| Priority | Board | Reason                                     |
| :------: | :---: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   G   | L5 start 5 adjacent, all in range 2        |
|    2     |   B   | L5 start 4 adjacent, all in range 2        |
|    3     |   C   |                                            |
|    4     |   E   | L7 start 3 adjacent, coast access limited  |
|    5     |   F   | L3 is problem! Awkward coast access        |
|    6     |   D   | Can't G2 into coast - all wetland/jungle   |
|    7     |   H   | Awkward coastal access                     |
|    8     |   A   | L7 start 2 adjacent(!!!), bad coast access |
