## Boards
Eyes prefers boards where every land is within range 1 of a jungle, so that their dahan-gathering unique is maximally effective.

| Priority | Board | Reason                              |
| :------: | :---: | :---------------------------------- |
|    1     |   E   | Fast jungle access, total coverage  |
|    2     |   B   | ""                                  |
|    3     |   H   | ""                                  |
|    4     |   A   | 1 land out of jungle coverage       |
|    5     |   C   | ""                                  |
|    6     |   A   | Same as above + bad dahan positions |
|    7     |   G   | ""                                  |
|    8     |   F   | ""                                  |
