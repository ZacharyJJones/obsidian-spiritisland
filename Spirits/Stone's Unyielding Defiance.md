## How to play Stone?
Go top track.

Opening:
1. G3 gain Minor, place from top track into land type 3 > Jagged Shards Push From the Earth
2. G3 gain Major, place from top track into land type 4 > Stubborn Solidity + Most relevant card
	- Draft the major before placing presence
- Turn 3 onwards, reclaim and play Stubborn Solidity + Jagged Shards/Best other card(s)
	- Can G3 when appropriate to expand options / reroll Major

You start by putting presence in each land type because you reclaim loop starting turn 3 which has more limited presence placement options. Avoid placing presence in Mountains on first two turns because later when you reclaim you can access those very easily.

Try out letting the first blight on your board come from the card instead of paying for it (typically turn 2 on first ravage). 2 energy can be a lot, and you'll have more flexibility with your drafted major because you let that one come from the card.

## Boards
### Great
Dahan pair nicely, no awkwardness in growth/land coverage
- Board C (except vs Sweden)
- Board G

### Good
Dahan can pair BUT growth/land coverage is awkward
- Board D
- Board E
	- Initial explore on wetlands can disrupt normal play pattern (Forces plows shatter T1)

### Okay 
Isolated Dahan placements and/or awkward growth/land coverage
- Board F
- Board A
- Board H
- Board B
