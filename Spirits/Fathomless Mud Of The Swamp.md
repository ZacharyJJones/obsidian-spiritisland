## Drafting

Keep a strong eye out for ![[moon.png]]![[water.png]] cards. Only 2 of the starting hand comes with ![[moon.png]] and a combination of both is very good to get.

## Boards
Land type variety adjacent to starting land is a big deal. It allows for smoothly dealing with first explores by way of special rule.
