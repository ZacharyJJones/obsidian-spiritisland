## Guides
- [[Volcano - Top Track Majors]]
- [[Volcano - G3 Bottom]]
- [[Volcano - Hybrid 6-Boom]]


## Unique Cards

- Rain of Ash
	- Stop a blight or city build, consolidate invaders
- Exaltation of Molten Stone
- Lava Flows
	- Badlands + Wilds is more valuable than 1 damage
- Pyroclastic Bombardment
	- Broke: kill 1 invader to stop a blight
	- Woke: Combo with eruption and/or badlands to wipe out swaths of invaders

## Play Patterns

Dahan Will Die
- It's inevitable that any Dahan around the Volcano are going to bite the dust. Evac them where you can to teammates' boards or accept their passing.
- Keep in mind that you can distribute damage to dahan in the most nonlethal way possible. This can help to keep them alive somewhat longer.

Children Yearn For The Mines
- You get a ton of free damage potential throughout the game because your eruptions deal damage both in YOUR land and in the TARGET land. Really try to have targets at home to get that extra value when you are exploding. There's no such thing as "too many" invaders in your home space.

Typical Opening / Pompeii
1. Consolidate invaders to land adjacent to presence (bonus points if imminent build there)
2. Lava Flows in that land for badlands
3. Pyroclastic Bombardment + Eruption into that land for insane damage

Top Level Innates Are Pipe Dreams
- Left innate mega-giga-boom takes a lot to pull off where smaller booms could have avoided the situation entirely
- Right innate has no relevant text after level 2

## Drafting

You get all the Fire and Earth ![[fire.png]] ![[earth.png]], and some Air ![[air.png]] for free from unique cards and presence tracks. Particularly for the bottom track build, draft for off-elements ![[sun.png]] ![[water.png]] ![[plant.png]] ![[animal.png]] where possible to facilitate any Majors you gain.

## Boards

### Great
- Board E (Land 5)
	- Coastal access
- Board F (Land 4)
- Board B (Land 7)
	- Tremendous multiplayer implications
	- Range 2 lands are tricky here

### Normal
- Board A (Land 1)
	- Land 8 is a big issue
- Board D (Land 5) - Nice for 6-booms as it starts with 5 adjacent lands
	- Lands 3 and 8 can be problems, but have redeeming factors (beast token, mountain)
- Board C (Land 7)
	- Far from coast, growing into Land 3 doesn't really solve your problems

### Avoid
- Board G
- Board H



## Spirit Friends

- Finder of Paths Unseen
	- They chuck a presence into your origin land turn 1, and funnel invaders into there for the rest of the game. You will ALWAYS have a bounty of targets for your eruptions.
- Sun-Bright Whirlwind
	- Funneling invaders your way? Yes Please! 1 damage to 5 different invaders?? Pyroclastic Please-And-Thank-You!
- River Surges in Sunlight
	- Dahan evac + consolidating invaders for you. Boon of Vigor will keep you well fed, consider bottom track build with earlier and greater numbers of majors. 
- BODAN
	- You disperse damage among invaders, BODAN swoops in to finish them off and generates metric tons of fear.
- Wildfire
	- Your range boost can help their limited reach quite a lot, and their damage boon will push you into red-hot lava territory.
