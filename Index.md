# Who?

Who cares?
# What

A set of spirit guides for my ***simple and EASY*** reference when I want to take a spirit out for a spin that I haven't in a while. While basic spirit information - board and unique cards - is available, it is assumed for the sake of brevity that these things do not need to be explained to you.
# Why?

After the incredible [Fangs guide by AryaFireheart](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFGPZG6-bU/qG-wqaOrgRNwNKwfKr5xSA/view#9) became unreachable on Canva, I realized I wanted to keep a personal copy of gameplay patterns and spirit strategies for myself - one which would not be subject to the whims of hosted platforms nor the original creators.

Most all of the information I keep here will be inspired by and adapted from the great work of the [LatentOctopus Spirit Island Hub](https://latentoctopus.github.io/) webpage, which compiles spirit guides and provides an accessible source of information for many spirits and their strategies.
# How?

It will all be pilfered. Shamelessly.
