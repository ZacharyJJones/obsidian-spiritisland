Topic - [[Rising Heat of Stone and Sand]]
### Intro
Sometimes your turn 1 G3 draft exposes a possibility for high-tempo gameplay. This is the play pattern you would take to capitalize on that possibility.

### Opening
1. G3, Minor (Looking for 0-cost ![[fire.png]])
	- If search success (48%): Play Sweltering Exhaustion (stop a build) + Gift
	- If search failure: Play Gift + minor
2. G2 Bot/Bot > all cards in hand.
3. Reclaim

### Other Notes
Allows for a very fast and powerful turn 1 & 2

Playing Gift on turn 1 and reclaiming turn 3 lets you give out more energy to the team
If you miss on the 0-cost draft turn 1 and don't want to continue the line, you can pivot back to the [[Heat - Standard G3]] strategy.
