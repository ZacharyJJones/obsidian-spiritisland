### Intro
Rushes bottom track to unlock a powerful reclaim loop. Strongly looks for a 0-cost ![[moon.png]]![[plant.png]] minor, which is necessary for full reclaim potential. 

### Opening
1. G3 Bot, minor > Mysterious Abductions + minor (only play minor if 0-cost)
	- Any 0 cost card is better than a 1 cost here.
2. G2 Bot/Bot > Remaining 3 unique cards
3. Reclaim > play cards as appropriate from here on out
4. G2 Bot/Bot
5. Reclaim loop starts here

### Other Notes
You get 3 chances to find one before normal loop timing begins. If you don't draft one at all, you can mix in an additional G2 at some point which will give you the energy income for a 1-cost ![[moon.png]]![[plant.png]] minor as part of the loop.
- Any allied spirit that can gift 2-3 energy over the course of the game will be a big help for maxing your innate.
