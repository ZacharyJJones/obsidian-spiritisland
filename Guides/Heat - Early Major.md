Topic - [[Rising Heat of Stone and Sand]]
### Intro
Not the strongest version of Heat, but good fun for variety or low-difficulty games.

### Opening
1. G3 Bot, Minor
2. G2 Top/Top
	- If you didn't play the drafted minor last turn, aim to do so now! You might want to forget it for the major, so it's good to get some value out of it in the mean time.
3. G3 Bot, Major
4. Reclaim

### Other Notes
What do I forget for a major?
- Probably the Minor you drafted on turn 1
- Sweltering Exhaustion is a decent option - the high cost will get in the way of the major
- Stinging Sandstorm is also decent, but has perfect elements so is a tough one to drop
