Topic - [[Shifting Memory of Ages]]
### Intro
The standard game plan for Memory, typically playing (and thresholding) a major power from turn 2 until the game ends.

When forgetting cards for majors, Boon or Study will be your first picks.

### Opening
#### Turn 1
G2, gaining a Major power
- If that major will not be useful next turn, pivot to either:
	- [[Memory - Slow Burn]]
	- [[Memory - Double Major]]
- Otherwise:
	- [[Memory - Fast Major#2 Cost|Major Costs 2]]
	- [[Memory - Fast Major#3 Cost|Major Costs 3]]
	- [[Memory - Fast Major#4 Cost|Major Costs 4]]
	- [[Memory - Fast Major#5+ Cost|Major Costs 5+]]


#### 2 Cost
If you want to play Boon on turn 1, follow the [[Memory - Fast Major#3 Cost|3 Cost]] plan.
1. G2 Top > unique card
2. G2 Bot, major costing 4 or less > 2-cost major + unique
3. G3 Top > major + unique
4. Reclaim Top > Play as appropriate

#### 3 Cost
If you need to play Boon on turn 1, your turn 3 and 4 plays are shifted back 1 BUT those card costs are more easily paid.
1. G2 Top > unique card
2. G3 Bot > major + unique
3. Reclaim Top > major + 0-cost unique
4. G2 Top, major > new major
	- The new major can be played this turn if it costs 3 or less, which is an 87% chance.

#### 4 Cost
1. G2 Top > unique card
2. G3 Bot > major + unique
3. Reclaim Top > Secrets + any minor
4. G2 Top, new major > any major

If you want to play the major on both turns 2 AND 3, instead do:
1. G2 Bot > unique card
2. G4 > major + unique
3. Reclaim top > major + unique
4. G2 Top, major > unique x2
5. G3 > major + unique
6. Reclaim

#### 5+ Cost
1. G2 Bot > unique card
2. G4 > major + unique
3. Reclaim Top > Secrets + unique

If you have spare energy on turn 3, you can G2 and pick up another major to use right away instead of reclaiming.

If you don't like your costly card, you can gamble on a re-draft with G2 on turn 2. If you are going to do that, you should grow top first to get the extra energy income.
