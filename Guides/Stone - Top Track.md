Topic - [[Stone's Unyielding Defiance]]
### Intro
Stone gets everything from it's top track - energy AND plays... AND drafts - so we go straight down that track while abusing it's reclaim to hit our innates.

### Opening
1. G3 gain Minor, place from top track into land type 3 > Jagged Shards Push From the Earth
2. G3 gain Major, place from top track into land type 4 > Stubborn Solidity + Most relevant card
	- Draft the major BEFORE placing presence, so that you have more information on elements needed to threshold the major.

Turn 3 onwards, reclaim and play Stubborn Solidity + Jagged Shards/Best other card(s)
- Can G3 when appropriate to expand presence into non-mountains or reroll drafted Major


### Other Notes

You start by putting presence in each land type because you reclaim loop starting turn 3 which has more limited presence placement options. Avoid placing presence in Mountains on first two turns because later when you reclaim you can access those very easily.

Try out letting the first blight on your board come from the card instead of paying for it (typically turn 2 on first ravage). 2 energy can be a lot, and you'll have more flexibility with your drafted major because you let that first expensive one come from the card.

Why do we keep playing Stubborn Solidity + Jagged Shards?
- The answer to that is because the dahan movement + preservation is a very powerful effect, and combines nicely with the damaging innate to deal with each land type as they come up.
