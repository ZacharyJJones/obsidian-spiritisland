Topic - [[Fathomless Mud Of The Swamp]]
### Intro

This is the homebrew opening I came up with myself. It aims to use the special rule often and not miss chances to draft with Exaltation.

Sometimes feels awkward with only hitting tier 1 or tier 2 of the innate (tier 2 is 1 damage). Presence movement on it's own is pretty good, so not the worst problem to have.

### Opening
1. G2 Top/Top > Open Shifting Waterways
	- Usually throw the dahan into the land where a building was prevented - prevents blight next turn and cleans up in the ravage
2. G3 Bot, Minor > Exaltation + Minor or Foul Vapors
3. G2 Bot/Bot > all cards in hand
	- Keep an eye on which land types you already have presence. Reclaim next turn adds at range 0, so would be good to place it anywhere they explore.
4. Reclaim, adding top (water) or bottom (moon) as appropriate
	- Consider gaining a major with Exaltation soon.
1. G2 or G3, probably go to 4 plays.
