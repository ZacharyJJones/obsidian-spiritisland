Topic - [[Sun-Bright Whirlwind]]
### Intro

Whirlwind's special rule pushing explorers and preventing builds is a very effective action you should make use of every turn. In this strategy, we lean on it a bit for turns 3 and 4 as we underplay and build up to a big turn 5 with plenty of cards to keep hitting innates from then onwards.

### Opening
1. G3 Bot, cheapest minor with ![[air.png]] (or cheapest useful card if no air) > Gift of Sunlit+ Minor
2. G2 Bot > Gift of Wind + Scatter + Tempest
3. Reclaim, minor > 2 cards
	- Start planning ahead for turn 5: You will need 2 ![[sun.png]] and 3 ![[air.png]] to reach the tier 3 innate.
4. G3 Bot, minor > 2 cards
5. G2/G3 Bot > All remaining cards
	- If you have enough energy to play all the cards in your hand, go for a G3 to try and hit the tier 4 innate. Otherwise G2 so you can play everything
6. Reclaim, play as appropriate
