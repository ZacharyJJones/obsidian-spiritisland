Topic - [[River Surges in Sunlight]]
### Intro
A standard and powerful opening that smoothly maxes Massive Flooding to clear land after land.

Plan your presence placement carefully, as you don't get any more once in the reclaim loop.
### Opening
1. G2 Bot/Bot > Bounty + Wash Away
2. G2 Bot/Bot, reclaim Bounty > Bounty + Flash Floods + Boon
3. Reclaim, minor > minor + Bounty
4. G2 Bot/Bot, reclaim bounty > ALL unique cards + 0-cost minor
	- If you don't already have one, eventually you will get a 0-cost minor to play as a 5th card.
5. Reclaim, minor > ALL unique cards + 0-cost minor

### Other Notes
After turn 5, you are in the reclaim loop. Between massive flooding and Flash Floods you can clear out a land every turn.

Eventually you will reach a turn that you don't need to reclaim on - G3 there and gain a major. Flash Floods is a good forget candidate as it is overcosted. Resume the loop.
