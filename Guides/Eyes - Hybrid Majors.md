Topic - [[Eyes Watch From The Trees]]
### Intro

Eyes needs majors! Focusing on energy income initially will pave the way toward playing impactful cards with everyone's favorite silly guy.

### Opening
1. G2 Top/Top > Abductions
	- Alternate T1 plays are available, if adversary calls for it:
		- Prep for city build, to destroy next turn: Whispered Guidance
		- Prevent incoming ravage next turn: Eerie Noises
2. G2 Top/Bot > Whispered Guidance + Boon (w/ innate, defends 2 places, sets up for next turn)
3. G3 Top, good time for major (forget abductions) > Eerie Noises + Major
	- You'll have 5 energy to blow on a major this turn
	- Major is recommended here, because you'll have a draft on reclaim next turn to move towards thresholding
4. Reclaim, major/minor (whatever you didn't do last turn)
5. G2 Bot/Bot
	- Getting to 3 card plays here is great, you are likely still drowning in energy. Thresholding will be easier.
6. Reclaim / G2 Top/Top to finish out energy track.
	- G2 is good if you had a sweet but expensive major.

### Other Notes
If you desperately need the defend 4 from your innate on turn 3, you can swap the timing for placing presence from bottom track on turns 2 and 3:
2. G2 Top/Top
3. G3 Bot, major
The growth pattern is the same but you play slightly fewer cards in exchange for getting that defend 4. Somewhat weaker in terms of actions played, but occasionally could be necessary.
