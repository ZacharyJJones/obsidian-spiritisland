Topic: [[Volcano Looming High]]
### Intro
The discerning player's thematic win - a hybrid track approach prioritizing G2s to set off a big eruption ASAP. Note that such a boom will not win the game on it's own - it won't often be correct to ignore a bunch of problems just to build up and hit this level of the innate.

This build shines when you have a starting land with a lot of adjacent lands that you can affect with the eruption. Consider if the effort to build up 6 presence and erupt them all will be worth it

### Opening

2. G2 Bot/Bot > Exaltation + Lava Flows | Erupt 2, Draft in slow to have a better T3
