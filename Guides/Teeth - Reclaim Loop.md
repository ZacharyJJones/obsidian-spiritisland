Topic - [[Devouring Teeth Lurk Underfoot]]
### Intro

A brain-dead way to play the worm that will get the job done most of the time.
### Opening
1. G3 Bot > Herd + Ferocious
2. Reclaim Top > Herd + Ferocious
3. Reclaim Top > Herd + Ferocious (you are now energy-neutral)
4. Reclaim Bot
5. Reclaim Bot
6. Reclaim Bot (you unlocked the 3rd card play!)
7. Reclaim Top (you need more energy for the extra card)
8. Reclaim Top (you should max innate now?)

### Other Notes
Not fun to cycle two cards without drafts or anything else happening.

Game probably ends before you get 3 card plays
