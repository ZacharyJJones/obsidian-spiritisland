Topic - [[Rising Heat of Stone and Sand]]
### Intro
Utilizes the power and convenience of Heat's 3rd growth option to smoothly play out cards and gain energy while advancing down bottom track.

Sweltering is put to good use on turns 1 or 2, both for the tempo of stopping a build or the infinite defense inherent to a ravage skip.

### Opening
1. G3, Minor > Herders(?) + any
	- Herders is a solid turn 1 play, however if you save it for turn 3 you can guarantee the innate.
1. G3, Minor > 
2. G3, Minor > 
	- This is the earliest turn that you can hit the Tier 2 innate. So plan ahead and hold the cards you need to make this happen! This can be done with Herders + Stinging + Gift/Any 0-cost fire card.
3. Reclaim, Minor, play as appropriate

### Other Notes
Variant is available on turn 3:
3. G2 Bot/Bot
The idea is to hit 4 card plays now, so that after your reclaim you will have a more powerful set of turns with more card plays. It slightly "wastes" card plays, but is also viable.
