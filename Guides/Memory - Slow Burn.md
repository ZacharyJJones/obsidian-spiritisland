### Intro

Plays it's first major 1 turn later compared to the standard "Fast Major" build. Has a more straightforward game plan as a result, with less tight energy management.

### Opening
1. G2 Top ("forget" Study) > Boon targeting self
2. G2 Bot, major (forget Boon or Study) > Secrets + Teachings
3. G3 Top > Major + Minor
	- You'll have 5 energy here, should be able to play most anything
4. G2 Top, minor > Major + Minor
	- You also have the option to reclaim this turn, if that better solves your problems
5. Reclaim, play as appropriate
