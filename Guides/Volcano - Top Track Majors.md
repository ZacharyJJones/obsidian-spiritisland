Topic: [[Volcano Looming High]]
### Intro
Volcano does not need to hit the top levels of it's innates. Because of this, it doesn't really need lots of card plays. Because of that, it can focus more into energy gains. Because it will be swimming in energy, it can invest into Major powers which will win the game.

### Opening
1. G2 Top/Bot
2. G3 Top
3. G3 Bottom
4. G3 Top
5. G3 Bottom
6. **Reclaim**
7. G3 Top
8. G3 Top

### Other Notes

Notice the G3 bottom on turn 3. This conservative estimate assumes a below-average first
few drafts for Earth elements, and the need to unlock the bottom track Earth element early. The average-case build probably goes bottom track on turn 4 more than turn 3, giving you 1 extra energy per game. This shift to bottom track is not only vital to continue hitting the re-
growth innate, but also to reach the 2nd card play node.

If you are lucky enough with drafting elements & card costs, you can continue drafting 2
cards per turn with G3 + innate and go down your top track for a long time before shifting to
unlock the second play or reclaim your cards. This build conservatively unlocks 5 energy on
the 8th turn – the average game probably hits that spot at least one turn earlier, but much
earlier is also possible.

You will almost always want to get to 2 plays before reclaiming, but if you find the perfect
major and need to run it back-to-back, don’t be afraid to reclaim and play only 1 card if
necessary.

Mixing in a G2 here and there where needed can work well. Because you reach the Earth
node on top track on T2 every game, you always stand to gain a 2-energy spike if ever going
T/T with G2. B/B will always increase your plays by 1 from any space on the track.
